When we write about it being half-term, we should remember that it’s known as mid-term in Scotland. When we write about bank holiday sunshine/rain, we should remember that in Scotland the weather was probably different and it possibly wasn’t even a bank holiday. When we write about the English cricket team, we should be careful not to refer to it as “we” and “us”.
